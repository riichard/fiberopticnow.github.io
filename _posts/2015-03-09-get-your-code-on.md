## Understanding the current diversity problem in tech startups is a call to action for educators

I've had the amazing opportunity to work both in the startup field, as well as in the classroom. For the past three years I have worked with educational startups, as well as a number of international startups doing freelance marketing. For me, I noticed the diversity gap in the tech sector almost immediately. Although many tech companies and startups are actively working to increase the number of women and people of color in their organizations, we still have a long way to go..

##Empower your students to try computer programming

Understanding the above diversity data in the tech sector is incredibly important for educators. This data clearly shows us that many women and people of color do not have equal access to careers in the tech sector.

###Resources for learning and/or teaching computer programming to children or adults

Check out the <a href="http://learn-computer-programming.zeef.com"> ultimate coding link directory </a> I created, which offers a curated list of coding resources from apps to in-person events. If you know of any awesome resources that I may have missed, please suggest them so that I can add them to the directory. Thank you so much!
